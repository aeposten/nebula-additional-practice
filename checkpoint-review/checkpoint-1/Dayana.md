## 3. What is the difference between using let, var, and const?

Your answer:
Var is mutuable and can be changed
Let cannot be changed
Const cannot be changed

You received partial credit. Let can be reassigned.

## 4. What is the difference between primitive and non-primitive data?

Your answer:
Primitive is already defined non primitive is created or made.

You received partial credit. You also needed to mention that primitive data-types are immutable, and non-primitive data-types are.

## 5. Explain the difference between null, undefined, and not defined

Your answer:
Undefined there’s no value assigned to the variable
Null is nothing
Not defined not given meaning or value

You received partial credit, you needed to mention that null is meant to act as a placeholder, and not defined is an error thrown by JavaScript.

## 8. In your own words, what does it mean to be a dynamically typed language?

Your answer:
I can assign and create what I want to a variable

You received partial credit, for statically typed languages the variable types have already been defined and are therefore  known at compile time, vs dynamically typed languages where the interpreter assigns the variable types at runtime.

## 11.How do you check an output in the terminal?

Your answer: 
node fileName
then click enter

I think maybe this wording threw people off, but the answer we were looking for is console.log
