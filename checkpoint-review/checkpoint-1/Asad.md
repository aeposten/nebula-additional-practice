## 5. Explain the difference between null, undefined, and not defined

Your Answer:
"null" is a value assigned intentionally when you want to represent a non-existent or an empty value.
"undefined "is when you declare a variable but do not assign it a value.
"not defined" is a variable which was not declared with var, let or const.

You received partial credit. Not defined is an error that javascript will thrown and undefined can be intentionally or unintentionally assigned.

## 11.How do you check an output in the terminal?
Your answer:
To check your output in the terminal you need to be in the same folder as the file your running. You can use "cd" to change your directory, and "ls" will list your directory to show you the files of the folder you are currently in. Once you see your file you will run "node filename."

I think maybe this wording threw people off, but the answer we were looking for is console.log.
