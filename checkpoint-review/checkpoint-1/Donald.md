##3.What is the difference between using let, var, and,const?

Your answer:
const = you cant change

let , var = you can change

You received partial credit, you needed to mention that var is older syntax and it is no longer recommended for use.

Here are some resources with more information:

##5. Explain the difference between null, undefined, and not defined

You answered:
null indicates there is no value , undefined has a value but isn't connect to a variable , were not defined tells you the variable does not exist.

You received partial credit, you needed to mention that null is meant to act as a placeholder, and not defined is an error thrown by JavaScript.

##6. Why would you give a variable the value of null?

Your answer:
you would do this when the value is unknown

You received partial credit, again you needed to mention that it is used as a placeholder.

##8.In your own words, what does it mean to be a dynamically typed language?

Your answer:
type of language that try's to guess what your saying as you type

You received partial credit, in dynamically typed  languages you do not have to specify the type of a variable when you initialize it. Instead the type is determined at runtime.

##11.How do you check an output in the terminal?

Your answer: node - then the name of the file you check

I think maybe this wording threw people off, but the answer we were looking for is console.log
