## 4. What is the difference between primitive and non-primitive data?

Your answer:
Primitive data-types contain one standard type such as a string, value, or boolean.
Non-primitive data-types account for groups of more than one of above such as an array.

You received partial credit. You also needed to mention that primitive data-types are immutable, and non-primitive data-types are.

## 8.In your own words, what does it mean to be a dynamically typed language?

Your answer: A dynamically-typed language is meant to run as a script in which the input and output can be changed more dynamically providing interactivity.
Whereas a statically-typed language similar to HTML would have minimal input/output features, or be a read-only webpage.

You received partial credit, for statically typed languages the variable types have already been defined and are therefore  known at compile time, vs dynamically typed languages where the interpreter assigns the variable types at runtime.
