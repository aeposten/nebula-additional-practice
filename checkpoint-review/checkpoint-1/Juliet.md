## 2. Write three different variables with different data types

Your answer:
Let
Var
Const

You received partial credit, you use let, var, and const to declare variables, but you didn't assign values to them.

## 3. What is the difference between using let, var, and const?

Your answer:
The difference between let, var, and const is, let allows you to change your value if you want to where as const is permanent and can not be changed and var allows you to update your variable, meaning you can give the same variable different values.

You received partial credit, you needed to mention that var is the older syntax.

## 4. What is the difference between primitive and non-primitive data?

Your answer:
Primitive data types cannot be changed once created, also they are compared by its values; where as, non-primitive data types can be changed after being created and are not compared by its values.

You received partial credit. You also needed to mention Primitive data-types contain one standard type such as a string, value, or boolean.
Non-primitive data-types account for groups of more than one of above such as an array.

## 5. Explain the difference between null, undefined, and not defined

Your answer:
The difference between null, undefined, and not defined; null is when a value is equal to nothing or zero where as undefined is when a variable is stated but isn't given a value and not defined is when a variable doesn't exist.

You received partial credit. You needed to mention that null is a placeholder, and not defined is an error thrown by JavaScript.

## 6. Why would you give a variable the value of null?

Your answer:
The reason to give a variable the value of null is because the value is equal to nothing or is equivalent to zero.

You received partial credit. You needed to mention that null is meant to be used as a placeholder.

## 8. In your own words, what does it mean to be a dynamically typed language? 

Your answer:
To be a dynamically typed language simply means that as a programmer you are able to write code correctly but with more flexibility possibly making it simple to learn, read, and understand.

In dynamically typed languages you do not have to specify the type of a variable when you initialize it. Instead the type is determined at runtime.
