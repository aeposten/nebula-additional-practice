Your answer:
Let
Var

You received partial credit, you use let, var, and const to declare variables, but you didn't assign values to them.

##3. What is the difference between using let, var, and const?

Your answer:
The difference between let, var, and const is, let allows you to change your value if you want to where as const is permanent and can not be changed and var allows you to update your variable, meaning you can give the same variable different values.

You received partial credit, you needed to mention that var is the older syntax.
